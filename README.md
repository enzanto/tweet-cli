# Tweet from terminal

This is just a super simple python script which allows me to tweet from my terminal. Will add support for mastodon soon

---

## setup
The setup is pretty easy, just make an alias that points to the script
alias tweet='/bin/python3 /home/user/Documents/Python/tweet-cli/main.py'
